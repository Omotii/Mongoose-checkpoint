In this checkpoint, a model was created and stored in the model folder with the name person.js

The model is required in the index.js where several CRUD operations are carried out on the PersonModel

All CRUD operations are commented out using the javascript multi-line comment syntax /* ----- */
while the comment meant to assist in reading the code are place in javascript single line comment syntax //

This is done to avoid all code running from top to bottom.
Rather comment can be removed systematically to run respective codes.

Thanks
